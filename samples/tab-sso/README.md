# Teams Tab Single Sign-on (SSO) Sample

## Summary

This sample shows how to create a tab for Teams that uses the built-in [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso) capabilities to get a secure token containing important user information like user display name, Azure AD Object Id, UPN and Tenant ID. The sample also shows how to create a web service to enable exchange for an [On-Behalf-Of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) token that can be used to call another service, such as the Microsoft Graph, to access additional capabilities.

Please note that using SSO does *not* eliminate the user seeing consent popups - these are still required in order to ensure the application has approval to access the user's information. To assist in this, read [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso#tenant-admin-consent) on how to have an administrator pre-consent on behalf of all the users in the organisation.

Below is a screenshot of the SSO tab in action (this is for the .NET version - the Node.js version shows the same information but in a slightly different way).

**Please note** that this sample actually contains two separate, alternate projects: a .NET version and a Node.js version. In addition, the .NET version uses a more 'vanilla JS' approach, in order to show how SSO can be implemented in such a scenario, and the Node.js version uses a React front end, in order to demonstrate SSO using a front end framework.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git
```

### 2. Register Azure AD application

For detailed steps on how to do this, read [Registering your app through the Azure Active Directory portal in-depth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso#registering-your-app-through-the-azure-active-directory-portal-in-depth).

### 3. Update app configuration & run the web application

**Dotnet Version**

* See the [`dotnet`](src/dotnet) folder inside this sample's `src` folder

**Node.js Version**

* See [`node`](src/node) folder inside this sample's `src` folder

### 4. Update & package the Teams app manifest

Inside the [`src`](src) folder for this sample is a [`manifest.json`](src/manifest.json) file. The following needs to be changed in this file:

1. The `"id"` value must be populated with a new Guid value. You can do this in various ways depending on your platform of choice, but a simple PowerShell command is: 
```powershell
New-Guid
```

2. The `{appId}` values (near the bottom of the manifest) must be replaced with the Azure Application ID you generated in step 2 above, when generating the new Azure AD application.

3. The `{ngrokSubdomain}` value must be replaced with whatever ngrok subdomain you are using. If you are using another tunneling tool, you might need to replace the entire `{ngrokSubdomain}.ngrok.io` value, and when you create a Production version of your application you will similarly need to supply a complete production URL.

4. From within the [`src`](src) folder, in the command line, run the `gulp` command (you will need the [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) task runner installed to do this). This will generate a .zip manifest file that can be easily uploaded to Microsoft Teams.

5. If using NodeJS version, the `{contentUrl}` value in staticTabs section must be replaced to `"https://{ngrokSubdomain}.ngrok.io/tab"` instead of `"https://{ngrokSubdomain}.ngrok.io/ssoDemo"`. The ssoDemo route is not available in the NodeJS version of the solution

### 5. Upload the manifest to Teams

There are a few possible options to do this, depending on your development tools and platform. The easiest is simple to use Teams' [App Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview) tool, in particular the [`manifest editor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview#manifest-editor) tab which allows you to import a manifest (i.e. the one you created in step 4 above) and immediately install it.

## Features

This sample demonstrates how to create a tab for Teams that uses Single-Sign-On (SSO) as well as how to exchange the SSO token for an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) token.
